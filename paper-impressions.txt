This paper contains a treatment of Darmon's Stark-Heegner point construction in the most general context I can think of. It does so in an efficient, elegant fashion. Roughly speaking, this paper is the hybridization of the work a large number of researchers on extending Darmon's construction with Spiess's automorphic cohomology formalism, the latter being the tool that allows the authors to work in full generality. I rather like this paper and it's definitely a welcome and useful contribution to the literature. But it's a souped-up survey paper, albeit a very good one. The new ingredient used in this paper is Spiess's cohomological formalism which, essentially, allows proofs already present in the literature to be adapted to a more general context. As such, the weakness of this paper is its originality. So if Algebra and Number theory wants to be a "one level below Annals and Inventiones" journal, it's probably not the right venue for this paper.


I quite like the paper under consideration. Since I've published a paper with the author extending its results, I was surprised to learn that it hadn't appeared years ago. Our more recent paper completely subsumes the results of the one under review so, as such, publication would not result in new results/techniques/ideas being added to the literature. Had I reviewed this paper 5 years ago, I certainly would have recommended its acceptance. It remains important to a number of researchers, myself included, for historical reasons since it spurred subsequent research. But the ideas and techniques it introduced are present in the literature and well-understood by the community. As such, scientific justification for its publication is somewhat lacking at this point in time.
